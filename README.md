Task Management Board

This is a Task Management Board where users can create tasks and organize them in different stages.
A task starts in To-Do, can be moved to In-Progress, and once completed, can be moved to Completed.
Users can perform full CRUD operations like POST, GET, PUT, DELETE.

MySQL as the database
